# DeepFaceOneShot

>  Reimplementation of *"Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition"* (Koch et al., 2015), adapted for deep facial recognition.

## Overview

This project is a faithful, modern reimplementation of the influential 2015 paper on Siamese Neural Networks for one-shot learning. Instead of using Omniglot characters, we apply the model to facial images â€” demonstrating how one-shot learning can be used to identify people with just **one example per identity**.

## Goals

- Recreate the Siamese Network architecture as described in the paper
- Train it on facial image pairs (same/different identity)
- Demonstrate one-shot classification on unseen faces
- Build an interactive app for real-time face matching
